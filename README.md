# LOS CARBONES
Welcome to "Los carbones" NASA Space Apps 2025 submission "Defender"

Defender is a website designed to educate with an interactive visualization and simulation tool that uses real data to help users model meteor impact scenarios, predict consequences, and evaluate potential mitigation strategies. It also includes a built-in AI chatbot named Cartonso to better help the education process and resolve common doubts people could have, enticing their curiosity with its intuitive and simple interface, and inspiring them to look for more; not only building a creative educational branch to start-up future engineers and scientists, but helping already working scientists to evaluate procedures and simulate real-life cases.
